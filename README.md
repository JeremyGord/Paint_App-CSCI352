Jeremy Gordon : PA#2 Welcome to Paint!!!

The goal- For this software is to implement features to modify the pen attributes and clear the canvas. I believe I have achieved the desired requirements to receive a good 
grade for PA#2.

How to run the program- The program is designed to be interacted with through a GUI. The user can click on the four colors on the bottom left to change the pen color. The user
can click the reset button on the lower left of the window to reset the pen back to its original properties. Additionally, in the lower left the user can click buttons to change
the pens thickness and clear the canvas for a new drawing.

Assumptions- I assume the user will not actively try and break the program/modify. 

Challenges- I originally tried to design the GUI with sliders to change color and pen thickness each with their own respective slider. After afew days with varying results I
decided to use a button approach instead. This was much simpler to implement although it reduced the variability in the color and pen thickness. 

Design decisions- I used buttons for the user controls because I was running out of time. I implemented four colors to add a few options of color to choose. I also implemented
two pen thicknesses for variety one being fine and one being thick. I implemented a reset button so that the user can just reset the pens attributes. I originally had reset the
pen coded into the clear button. Pushing the clear button reset the canvas and pen. I figured the user might want to just change the pen back to its original setting, so I 
implemented a separate button for resetting the pens attributes. 

Bugs- After testing it would appear there are no outstanding bugs at this time.

Results- Using the sliders to control color and pen thickness was harder than I assumed when is started the project.
Additional Functionality- If I had more time, I would try to figure out how to implement sliders to decide pen color instead of buttons. This would give the user more control 
and variety over the pens color.
